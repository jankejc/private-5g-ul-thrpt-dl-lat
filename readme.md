Meeting Industrial 5G Requirements for High Uplink Throughput and Low Control Latency in UGV Scenarios
Submitted to Applied Sciences (MDPI), 2025
Authors: Jan Kornacki, Aleksandra Wójcikowska, Michał Hoeft

🔍 Project Overview
As part of the ongoing transformation towards Industry 4.0, real-time control and high-throughput sensor data transfer via 5G are becoming essential in environments involving unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and LiDAR-based mapping.

This project evaluates how commercial 5G standalone equipment performs under different base station configurations, with a focus on:

Uplink throughput optimization

Downlink latency minimization

Robust performance under variable signal conditions

Compatibility with industrial use cases defined in 3GPP TR 22.804 and TR 22.829

🧪 Experimental Setup
Testbed: PL5G Laboratory at Gdańsk University of Technology

Devices: Amarisoft Callbox, Ouster OS0 LiDAR, Mikrotik 5G router, Husarion Panther UGV

Evaluation Metrics: RTT latency, uplink throughput, SNR, MCS levels

Test Conditions: Variable attenuation, multiple LiDAR configurations, 24 gNB parameter sets

📈 Key Contributions
Real-world validation of 5G NR uplink performance for LiDAR-equipped UGVs

Identification of parameter configurations that meet strict industrial latency and throughput demands

Comparison of latency-optimized vs. throughput-optimized base station profiles under real traffic conditions
